    <p>Are you a parent whose child came out to you? Love them (as you should) for who they are, 
        but not sure where to go, how to support them, or how you can educate yourself? I shall do
        my best to guide you!
    </p>

    <p>There's not much to say. This isn't anything like a phase, confusion, nor a complete change of their character.
        Your child is still your child, and that is all that matters. You were there for them before, so you should be
        here for them now.
