    and feel as if the whole world is against you, I want you to know that as 
    the person typing this, I wish I could give you a hug. To let you know that you
    are not alone, and to help you get back on your feet, I looked into several 
    shelters that are LGBTQIA+ friendly.

    <p>Here's a little calculator to mess around with.</p>
